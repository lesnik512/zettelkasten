- [[SOLID]] principle, when directions of the source code dependency and the flow of control can be different
- High–level modules should not depend on low–level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
